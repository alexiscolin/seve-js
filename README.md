# ðŸŒ³ seve-js
Simple and light JS components manager. Made for creative JamStack websites, it helps you to manage the components lifecycle across the app and facilitate communucation between them. perfect to work in a component style in addition to a router as BarbaJS.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Built With

* [JS ES6/7/8](https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc39/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Made as an `App` class, initialize the component to use it. It will start components init phase.
All components are extended from a `Component` class and initialized when they are encontred in the DOM.
In addition to components, seve-js let you use `modules` that can be linked to components even if they are not instanciate from the DOM.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm i sevejs@latest
  ```

* yarn
  ```sh
  yarn add sevejs
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alexiscolin/seve-js.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   
## Usage

Basic usage :

Add a component directly in your html
```html
<nav class="..." data-component="navigation" data-component-id="main">
    ...
</nav>
```
_Note: data-component-id is optional but recommended to target a very specific component (if muliple instances loaded)._

List all your components in a specific file
``` javascript
// components.js -> export here all your components
export {Header} from './components/header';
export {Navigation} from './components/navigation';
export {Slider} from './components/slider';
...
```
Create your app related to your components
``` javascript
// app.js -> export here all your components
import { App } from 'sevejs';
import * as components from './js/components';

const app = new App({components});
app.init(app)
...
```

Finaly, fill and export your components
``` javascript
// navigation.js -> here is a nav component
import { Component } from 'sevejs';
const Navigation = class extends Component {
    constructor(opts) {
        super(opts); // "opts" arg from constructor to super is a mandatory to share components across the app
        
        // GENERAL
        const {el} = this.DOM; // DOM component element
        this.events = {}; // map of binded events
        ...
    }

    init() {
        // automatically called at start
        ...
    }
    
    resize (size) {
        // automatically called at start
        ...
    }
    
    destroy () {
        // destroy here all vars, related modules/packages or events
        ...
    }
}

export { Navigation };
```

## App Methods
Here are the list of methods made for App instance: those methods rules over all the components that are grouped in its inner map. They should be used for app lifecycle purpose in the routing controle system of the app (eg related to BarbaJS or other dispatcher).

| Methods   | Description                                                                                | Arguments                                                                                                                                        |

| `update`  | Update app component system                                                                | - `scope` : *(HTMLElement)* - scope that will be parsed in update                                                                                         |
| `destroy` | Destroy app system and all related components (not modules that should be removed manualy) | - `scope` : *(HTMLElement - optional)* - destroy all components from a specific DOM part or global if not specified.                                      |

## Components Methods
The following methods are describe the functions you can use inside the components. They are made for simplify sharing data or create link between components. they let you call for a method from another component, subscribe to a modification triggered in another (from a pubsub inner broker). They also simplify DOM event creation by managing calling, updating and destroying of their callbacks.

## Modules Methods

Modules are directly instanciated in the component an are very coupled to them. They aim to split a very long component in many sub-modules. Their lifecycle should be managed manually. Also, they are not accessible from the App instance, so they can use components methods by calling them from the getComponent method bellow.

| Methods        | Description                                              | Arguments / return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `getComponent` | Method that retrieve a component from the component list | - `comp` : *(string)* - Name of the component you want retrieve. eg "Scroller"<br> - `id` : *(string - optional)* - The id of the component you want. If not set, the first entry will be returned. eg "Main". <br><br> `return` - The component. |
